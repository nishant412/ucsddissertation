In the previous chapters, I described empirical measurement studies aimed at  the "hidden in the noise" challenge of auditing wireless ad-hoc links in urban areas. We observed that it is indeed possible to uniquely identify a particular Bluetooth target device, even with several surrounding Bluetooth devices.

The other challenge of wireless auditing across large metropolitan areas is the slow scanning speed of conventional Bluetooth scanning tools.

This is a problem for wardriving scenarios, because we are at a location for a very short time which is not sufficient to scan for all devices in the vicinity.

Consequently, we end up missing devices in Bluetooth scans resulting in incomplete audits.

In this chapter we present the design of a low-cost SDR based tool to perform fast Bluetooth scanning, enabling complete coverage in wardriving based urban scenarios.
