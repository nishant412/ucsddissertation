\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:hyperscanner:concl}
In this chapter, we presented the design of a low-cost multi-channel fast Bluetooth scanning tool. 
%
We developed a multi-channel scanning protocol and resolved hardware challenges of PAPR and analog bandwidth limitations of PlutoSDR.
%
These measures allowed us to perform this wideband multi-channel scanning on a low-cost commodity tool such as the PlutoSDR.
%
The new scanner significantly speeds up classic Bluetooth device discovery over conventional single-channel smartphone scanners.
%
By finding Bluetooth devices faster and more reliably, our tool significantly reduces the chances of missing devices in Bluetooth scans during wardriving.
%
Our scanner therefore enables truly comprehensive urban scale audits of our distributed network of "wireless ad-hoc" links.
