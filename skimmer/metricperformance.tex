\begin{enumerate}
  \item Yeah, we caught, like 12 skimmers across 3 metropolitan areas.
  \item See that graph with the decreasing bars, we had like, 20 devices that were 6/6, and
    a few hundred 5/6. This was enough for manual analysis.
  \item Station based rssi clustering based on a heatmap in order to colocate the skimmer at
    the pump.
  \item Image of our cool point maps?
