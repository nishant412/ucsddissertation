Gas pump skimming is one of the most pervasive forms of payment card attacks in
	the U.S. today.
%
Gas pump skimmers are easy to install and difficult to detect: criminals can open gas pump enclosures
	and hide a skimmer in internal payment wiring.
%
%Internal gas pump skimmers are also difficult to detect: they are not visible
%	from outside of the pump, and they blend into the wiring inside the pump.
%
As a result, officials have resorted to detecting skimmers by performing
	laborious manual inspections of the wiring inside gas pumps.
% 
In addition, criminals can also avoid being caught using skimmers: many gas
	pump skimmers have Bluetooth connectivity, allowing criminals to collect
	payment data safely from inside their car.
 
In this work, we evaluate if the use of Bluetooth in skimmers also creates an opportunity
	for officials to detect them without opening gas pumps.
%
%officials can scan detect skimmers by scanning for Bluetooth devices inside
	%gas pumps.
%
We performed a large-scale study where we collected Bluetooth scans at
	\visitedgasstations~gas stations in six states. We detected a total of
	\totalskimmers~Bluetooth-based skimmers across four U.S. states---all of which were
	recovered by law enforcement.
%
We discovered that these skimmers were clearly distinguishable from legitimate
	devices in Bluetooth scans at gas stations.
%
We also observed the nature of gas station skimming: skimmers can be installed
	for months without detection, and MAC addresses of skimmers may reveal the
	criminal entity installing or manufacturing them.
