%Internal gas pump skimmers are also difficult to detect: they are not visible

Attackers are misusing the ubiquity of wireless access links by implanting illicit wireless links to covertly gain unauthorized access to public infrastructure~\cite{arizona-2018,florida-2018}.
%
These illicit wireless links are "hidden in the noise" of tens of others such links at public locations.

In this chapter, I describe the results of a measurement study to understand the feasibility of using link-layer information from smartphone Bluetooth scans to identify these illicit links.
%
In particular, we target a specific real-world problem --- Bluetooth-based payment card skimmers.
