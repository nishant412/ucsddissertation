%Gas pump skimmers are easy to install : criminals can open gas pump enclosures
%	and hide a skimmer in internal payment wiring.
%
%Internal gas pump skimmers are also difficult to detect: they are not visible
%	from outside of the pump, and they blend into the wiring inside the pump.
%
%whAs a result, officials have resorted to detecting skimmers by performing
%	laborious manual inspections of the wiring inside gas pumps.

%In addition, criminals can also avoid being caught using skimmers: many gas
%	pump skimmers have Bluetooth connectivity, allowing criminals to collect

In this chapter, I present a real-world empirical study aimed at understanding whether smartphone Bluetooth scans provide sufficient information to uniquely distinguish Bluetooth skimmers from the myriad of Bluetooth devices at a gas station.
%
In this 19-month measurement study, we collected Bluetooth scans at \visitedgasstations~gas stations across six states in the US, detecting \totalskimmers~Bluetooth-based skimmers among thousands of other Bluetooth devices at the stations. 
%

We observed that indeed Bluetooth links in skimmers can be differentiated from other legitimate devices using Bluetooth scan data.
%
However, legitimate devices may also utilize the same Bluetooth modules as skimmers and that is a common source of confusion.
%
In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of how successful can investigators get when trying to search for these skimmers using a Bluetooth scanning app.
