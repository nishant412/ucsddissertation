\subsection{Internal Skimmer Installation}
\label{sec:bkgd-install}

To install an internal skimmer, the perpetrator must open the fuel dispenser to access the internal PoS terminal wiring.
%
Unfortunately, during the night time, a fuel station may have a single attendant, and in some cases, may be completely
unattended.
%
Skimmer installers use a vehicle to block an attendant's view of a pump and distracting the attendant in order
to allow another perpetrator to install a skimmer without being seen~\cite{skimmerinstall1,skimmerinstall2}.

\paragraph{Fuel dispenser security} Because fuel dispensers have not, historically, contained anything of value, their physical
security was limited to using special ``security'' screws to prevent casual vandalism~\cite{ny-fuel-paymentdoor-access}.
%
Only slightly harder to open are dispensers such as the Gilbarco Advantage, Gilbarco Encore 300 and Gilbarco 500s that
use a single master key easily purchased on eBay.
%
 Fuel stations, especially those in areas where skimmers are common, are also starting to use tamper-evidence seals on
their dispensers.
%
These seals are not difficult to come by, and criminals have been known to purchase rolls online.~\cite{sealsForSale}
%
An alternative to preventing access to PoS terminal internals is to secure magnetic stripe data before it leaves the
card reader itself, however, this requires a costly upgrade to the PoS terminal.

\paragraph{EMV} EMV cards, colloquially called \emph{chip cards}, are another potential mitigation.
%
However, criminals in countries with EMV standardization have already begun to develop \emph{shimmers} capable
of skimming chip cards~\cite{krebshimmer}.
