\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

In this section we motivate augmenting existing methods of routine and
complaint-based manual inspection with Bluetooth-based skimmer detection.
%
First we explain why it is challenging to find skimmers:
%
historical records of skimmer recoveries reveal that only a small number of
skimmers have been found at a large number of gas stations.
%
Then we discuss how the result of this needle-in-a-haystack problem is that
there is a significant amount of time for criminals to install skimmers
before they are detected, leading to many fuel stations being repeatedly victimized.
%
Finally, we explain why it is worthwhile to explore Bluetooth-based detection,
and how it can augment manual inspection.

% investigators.

% Below may be unneccesary
%
% Bluetooth modules are a self-contained circuits that have all of the hardware
% and firmware necessary to communicate with other Bluetooth devices.
% %
% We suspect that skimmer builders prefer to use these self-contained Bluetooth modules because
% they are reliable, and they avoid design and testing costs associated with
% engineering RF hardware, and implementing a Bluetooth protocol stack.
% %
% As such, the same modules that are used in skimmers, are also used in a wide range of
% Bluetooth-enabled products, such as: programmable road signs, wireless
% thermometers, portable printers, and On-Board Diagnostic (OBDII) readers for
% automobiles.
% %
% They are also so well regarded for their ease of use that they are featured in
% several online tutorials for incorporating Bluetooth into Arduino and Raspberry
% Pi projects\footnote{Even DigiKey has an official tutorial for the RN modules
% \url{https://www.digikey.com/eewiki/display/Wireless/Getting+Started+with+RN42+Bluetooth+Module}
% and a tutorial for the HC modules is in an O'Reilly Book
