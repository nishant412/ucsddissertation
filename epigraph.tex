    True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,\\
    As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.\\
    'T is not enough to no harshness gives offence,---\\
    The sound must seem an echo to the sense.

    You write with ease to show your breeding,\\
    But easy writing's curst hard reading.

    \noindent Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for
    writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve
    his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and
    often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a
    good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.
