abstract = {We propose CV-Track, a real-time, low-complexity BLE signal detection scheme that leverages carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation of commodity BLE chipsets to enable detection of the intact part of a partially corrupted BLE packet. It detects BLE signal by observing the variation of the estimated CFO values based on the finding that the CFO values are almost constant for BLE signal while dispersing otherwise. With CV-Track, we can salvage useful information such as received signal strength from an erroneous BLE packet which would otherwise be wasted. We implement a prototype of CV-Track on commodity BLE chipset and evaluate its performance in an indoor environment. Our results indicate that CV-Track detects significantly more BLE packets compared with legacy BLE receiver under cross-technology interference.},

abstract = {Overheating smartphones could hamper user experiences. While there have been numerous reports on smartphone overheating, a systematic measurement and user experience study on the thermal aspect of smartphones is missing. Using thermal imaging cameras, we measure and analyze the temperatures of various smartphones running diverse application workloads such as voice calling, video recording, video chatting, and 3D online gaming. Our experiments show that running popular applications such as video chat, could raise the smartphone's surface temperature to over 50$^circ$C in only 10 minutes, which could easily cause thermal pain to users. Recent ubiquitous scenarios such as augmented reality and mobile deep learning also have considerable thermal issues. We then perform a user study to examine when the users perceive heat discomfort from the smartphones and how they react to overheating. Most of our user study participants reported considerable thermal discomfort while playing a mobile game, and that overheating disrupted interaction flows. With this in mind, we devise a smartphone surface temperature prediction model, by using only system statistics and internal sensor values. Our evaluation showed high prediction accuracy with root-mean-square errors of less than 2$^circ$C. We discuss several insights from our findings and recommendations for user experience, OS design, and developer support for better user-thermal interactions.},

abstract = {We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto.},
